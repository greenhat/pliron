# Programming Languages Intermediate RepresentatiON

![Status](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This is an intermediate representation framework for programming languages,
with the goal of, eventually, representing the language specified by
[MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/LangRef/).

The framework is written in Rust, and hopes to, at some point,
provide a compiler infrastructure for general use.
